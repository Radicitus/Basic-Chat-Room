# Simple-CLI-Chat-Room

To run this program locally:
- Open/Navigate to the project folder in command line
- Type `python3 srv.py`
- This will automatically create a new chat server on the local ip 127.0.0.1 and port 6900. To use a custom ip/port combo add them as arguments `python3 srv.py <ip> <port>`
- To init a client, in a new window type `python3 cli.py <ip> <port>`
- For example, to join a default chat server you would use `python3 cli.py 127.0.0.1 6900`
- You can create as many new clients as you want by using the above code snippets in new command line windows. 

Read the project description document to see a block by block break down of how the code works. Have fun!
